<p><h2>If the computer is not booting, the problem could be:</h2></p>
<p><h3>Ram</h3></p>
<p><h4>When installing the RAM, you may not think it can cause a "no-boot" situation. luckily for you this can be an easy fix! When installing RAM, without proper research
you could have easily installed the wrong type of RAM, installed too much RAM, and you couldve installed it incorrectly ( leaving some of the gold pins on the bottom of the ram withut proper contact.)
check these issues and perform research before progressing!</h4></p>
<p><h4>If these are found to be the issue or none of these are the issue and you beleive its the ram (or know so) use the folowing link to help you even further.</h4></p>

<p><h3>Motherboard</h3></p>
<p><h4>The Motherboard can be a huge factor while the computer is not working. All of the normal things would start up such as, the fans, cpu/cpu cooler, and the hard drives but there will be no display!
if your motherboard or case came with a speaker of sorts, make sure it is connected to the mother board and from there it should give you a post beep. it can beep more than once and it can also beep continously.
while all the beeps could give you a possibility of a motherboard error, it can also give you another hardare possibility and you can go through the process of elimination to figure out if it is or isnt the motherboard itself.
 this process will guide you through what could be wrong with all components of the computer but i fond it more useful to diagnose the Motherboard.</h4></p>

<p><h3>Processor</h3></p>
<p><h4> While it is very unlikely for a processor to go bad there is a chance it could be the problem to your no boot issue. A bad or faulty processor can be caused by power spikes, a motherboard failure and severe overheating. You would want to monitor the tempature of your processor and if it is overheating
 then you might want to look into getting a better CPU Cooler.</h4></p>
<h4>Cpu coolers:Rated in my opinion</h4>

<p><h3>PSU or Power Supply</h3></p>
<p><h4>If the computer has a no boot scenario, the power supply is the first peice of equipment that you should check. When i had an issue with one of the first Computers that i had helped repair, i used more than one way to diagnose the issue.
the first way i checked to see if the PSU was starting up was a simple one, check to see if the power supply's cooling fans are spinning. this will tell you if the PSU is completely fried or not. another ay i checked to see if the power supply was still working was to jump it. to do this you take a paperclip,unfolded, and stick one end into the green wire connection and the other in the ground wire(black) connection.
Make sure that if you do this, all other connection to the other equipment is disconnected. once both ends of the paperclip are in the conections, the power supply should start up, if not chances are youll need a new power supply.</h4></p>
